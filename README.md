# NanoBeat: Programmable Drum Machine using Arduino Nano

NanoBeat is a simple and customizable programmable drum machine designed specifically for the Arduino Nano microcontroller board. It aims to be a fun and educational project, created by a college freshman, to explore the world of music, programming, and electronics.

NanoBeat utilizes the capabilities of the Arduino Nano at its core, providing a compact and versatile platform for creating and playing drum patterns. It uses a simple buzzer to generate the drum sounds.

To enhance user interaction, NanoBeat is designed to be programmed using a 20x4 LCD display and five buttons. The LCD display provides a visual interface, displaying the indexes of the drum hits and a cursor to navigate through the pattern. The buttons allow users to navigate the pattern, change the drum/rest status, and adjust the tempo with BPM (beats per minute) control.
